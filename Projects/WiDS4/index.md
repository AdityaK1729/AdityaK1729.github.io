# Probability Based IPL Simulator

## Description
We will develop an IPL simulator model similar to how FIFA/EAFC simulates football games. We will use existing datasets to create a probability distribution based on different parameters, and using this new data, we will make a prediction for who wins IPL 2025.

## Resources for Week 1 (13th December-19th December)
For week 1, we will start with some basics of Python and a few libraries. If you have some good resources yourself, feel free to follow that. Otherwise, use the following:
- [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python) Do upto functions here.
- [NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy) Mainly we will be using NumPy Random, so focus on that.
- [Pandas Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas) This is important for importing and playing around with the dataset.

If you are already familiar with python, you might play around and explore a bit of the dataset (which you can find below on this page). 

Roughly what we are going to do is analyse each player in the dataset, that how he score runs, and the exact probability distribution on each ball, then we will run the simulation bowler against the batsman (based on the exact team matchup), and based on the points table and playoffs, we will predict the winner. You can find a really basic version of the idea [here](https://github.com/AdityaK1729/IPLProbSimulator).

Soon, I will post an assignment based on the above concepts, which will be a mandatory requirement for certification, as I don't want this to be just one-day coding project, so I sincerely request you to all the above-mentioned tasks this week only.

## Dataset
Here is the dataset 
[IPL 2024 Ball-by-Ball Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahiltailor/ipl-2024-ball-by-ball-dataset). Credits to Kaggle user [Sahil Tailor](https://www.kaggle.com/sahiltailor) for the dataset.
