# Probability Based IPL Simulator

We will create an IPL simulator model similar to how FIFA/EAFC simulates football games. We will use existing datasets to create a probability distribution based on different parameters, and using this new data, we will make a prediction for who wins IPL 2025.

## Week 1 Resources
For week 1, we will start with some basics of Python and a few libraries. If you have some good resources yourself, feel free to follow that. Otherwise, use the following:
- [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python) Do till functions here 
- [NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy) Mainly we will be using NumPy random, so do that pretty well
- [Pandas Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas)
- Dataset: [IPL 2024 Ball-by-Ball Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahiltailor/ipl-2024-ball-by-ball-dataset)
